# 🌌 Particle Morph

A dynamic **particle morphing** visual built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and GLSL shaders. Morph between different 3D shapes and text using smooth GPU-accelerated particle transitions.

## 🔧 Features

* GPU-based particle system using GLSL shaders
* Morphs between multiple shapes and text objects
* Interactive camera with orbit controls
* Smooth transitions with customizable timing
* Lightweight and browser-friendly

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** – for 3D rendering
* **GLSL** – custom vertex/fragment shaders
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – application logic
* **HTML + WebGL** – frontend environment

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luzisrepo/particle-morph.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project:

   ```bash
   cd particle-morph
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
   *or use a live server for best performance.*

---

## 🧪 Customization

* Modify the shapes/text in `src/morphTargets.js`
* Tweak morph speed, particle size, and more in `src/config.js`
* Update shaders in `shaders/vertex.glsl` and `shaders/fragment.glsl`
